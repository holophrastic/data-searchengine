# ABSTRACT: Query to pass to an engine.

with 'MooseX::Storage::Deferred';

use Data::SearchEngine::Meta::Attribute::Trait::Digestable;
use Digest::MD5;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The query object has some common attributes one would expect when performing
a search. It has the added benefit of producing a digest that can be used
with L<Data::SearchEngine::Results> ability to serialize to implement caching.

If you add new attributes to a subclass, be sure and add the Digestable
trait to any attributes you want to be included in the digest as document in
L<Data::SearchEngine::Meta::Attribute::Trait::Digestable>.

=attr count

The number of results this query should return.

=cut

has count => (
    traits => [qw(Digestable)],
    is => 'ro',
    isa => 'Int',
    default => 10
);

=attr debug

A string value denoting that this query should include debugging information
in the response.  Uses a string as the type because some search indexes
allow you to specify the type of debugging.  For those that just use a flag,
the predicate should be checked so that any true value results in debugging.

=method has_debug

Returns true if this Query has a value for debug.

=cut

has debug => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str',
    predicate => 'has_debug'
);

=attr facets

A HashRef of facets used with the query.  The key should be the facet name and
the value is the facet's value.  Consult the documentation for your backend to
see how this is used (if at all).

=method facet_names

Get the names of all facets.

=method get_facet

Get the value for the specified facet.

=method has_facets

Predicate that returns true if this Query has any facets.  Actually, it
returns the count but it does the same thing.

=method set_facet

Set the value for the specified facet.

=cut

has facets => (
    traits => [ 'Hash', 'Digestable' ],
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'HashRef[Any]',
    default => sub { {} },
    handles => {
        facet_names => 'keys',
        get_facet => 'get',
        set_facet => 'set',
        has_facets => 'count'
    }
);

=attr fields

The fields to return.  Some search engine backends allow you to only return
part of a document.

=method has_fields

Returns true if this query has fields specified.

=cut

has fields => (
    traits => [qw(Digestable)],
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str|ArrayRef[Str]',
    predicate => 'has_fields'
);

=attr filters

A HashRef of filters used with the query.  The key should be the filter name
and the value is the filter's value.  Consult the documentation for your
backend to see how this is used.

=method filter_names

Return an array of filter names that are present in this query.

=method get_filter

Gets the value for the specified filter.

=method has_filters

Predicate that returns true if this query has filters.

=method set_filter

Sets the value for the specified filter.

=cut

has filters => (
    traits => [ 'Hash', 'Digestable' ],
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'HashRef[Any]',
    default => sub { {} },
    handles => {
        filter_names=> 'keys',
        get_filter => 'get',
        set_filter => 'set',
        has_filters => 'count'
    }
);

=attr index

The index we will be querying.  Some search engine backends allow multiple
indices and need this attribute.

=method has_index

Returns true if this query has an index specified.

=cut

has index => (
    traits => [qw(Digestable)],
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str|ArrayRef[Str]',
    predicate => 'has_index'
);

=attr order

The order in which the results should be sorted.

=cut

has order => (
    traits => [qw(Digestable)],
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str|ArrayRef|HashRef',
    predicate => 'has_order'
);

=attr original_query

The "original" query that the user searched for.  Provided because some
backends may need to modify the C<query> attribute to a more palatable form.
If no value is provided for this attribute then it will assume the same
value as C<query>.

=cut

has original_query => (
    traits => [qw(Digestable)],
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str|Undef',
    lazy => 1,
    default => sub { my $self = shift; return $self->query }
);

=attr page

Which page of results to show.

=cut

has page => (
    traits => [qw(Digestable)],
    is => 'ro',
    isa => 'Int',
    default => 1
);

=attr query

The query string to search for.  This attribute may be a Str, ArrayRef or a
HashRef.  Some backends (like ElasticSearch) require complex data structures
to perform searches and need a HashRef for their queries. B<NOTE:> It is
advised that you set C<original_query> to a string so that the results
object has a clean string to show end-users.

=method has_query

Returns true if this Query has a query string.

=cut

has query => (
    traits => [qw(Digestable)],
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str|HashRef|ArrayRef',
    predicate => 'has_query'
);

=attr type

The type of query to use.  Some backends (Solr and ElasticSearch) will use a
query type, if specified.

=method has_type

Returns true if this Query has a type set.

=cut

has type => (
    traits => [qw(Digestable)],
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str',
    predicate => 'has_type'
);

=method digest

Returns a unique digest identifying this Query.  Useful as a key when caching.

=cut

sub digest {
    my $self = shift;

    my $digester = Digest::MD5->new;

    my @attributes = $self->meta->get_attribute_list;
    foreach my $aname (@attributes) {
        my $attr = $self->meta->get_attribute($aname);

        next unless $attr->does('Digest::SearchEngine::Meta::Attribute::Trait::Digestable');

        if($attr->has_digest_value) {
            $digester->add(lc($attr->digest_value));
        } else {
            my $reader = $attr->get_read_method;
            my $val = $attr->$reader;
            if(defined($val)) {
                $digester->add(lc($val));
            }
        }

    }
    return $digester->b64digest;
}

=method has_filter_like

Returns true if any of the filter names match the provided subroutine:

  $query->set_filter('foo', 'bar');
  $query->has_filter_like(sub { /^fo/ })s; # true!

=cut

sub has_filter_like {
    my ($self, $predicate) = @_;

    return grep { $predicate->() } $self->filter_names;
}
